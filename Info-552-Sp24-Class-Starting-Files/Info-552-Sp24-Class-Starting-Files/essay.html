            <p>Once my mom, when talking about analyzing stories, very exasperatedly said “I don’t want to analyze things, I just want to enjoy them”. This blew my mind because for me analysis was part of the enjoyment. I couldn’t imagine not wanting to dig into a story and dissect it in search of deeper meanings.</p>
            <p>Words appealed to me. I adored the way people twisted language into something that captivated the senses. I wanted to know why certain turns of phrase intrigued me and why writers chose the words they did. I wanted to rip stories apart and piece them back together to understand the complexities of the heart that beat within them and willed this literary world into existence where nothing had been before.</p>
            <p>Another reason I read was because I was alone. The second youngest in a family of five with siblings mostly out of the house and parents who worked full time. Traversing through the world is a troubling experience when you have no one to explain it.</p>
            <p>Unprompted when I was about 9 or 10 years old, I wrote an essay on <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i>. Perhaps calling it an essay is a stretch, but after reading the book nearly a dozen times I sat down at our family computer and began to write. I went through the story chapter by chapter, step by step, and talked through my feelings and opinions on each scene. It was bursting with color-coordinated passages as I became a surgeon sewing together my thoughts on the adventure before me.</p>
            <p>I feel we too often forget what made <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i> special. It was not about a curious girl who wanted to go on an adventure or experience a new magical world. It was about a girl dropped down a rabbit hole into a world she didn’t understand and was surrounded by people who refused to help her. To me that was the experience of growing up, of being a child, of learning about the world.</p>
            <p>Adults seem to forget children do not have the same outlook on life as them, so they’re dismissed as silly. This is why many people try to give <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i> a new lesson because they dismiss the original story as nonsense. That’s because it’s not a story for adults but for children.</p>
            <p>With my essay, I put the book under a microscope and tried to detail my thoughts on Alice and her story. I wanted to explain how this was not a tale of growing up or acceptance, but instead a story capturing the heart of what it means to be a child. My enjoyment of the story was cemented as I analyzed beneath its surface to a deeper level.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t just a book but a living thing accompanying me through my childhood. Alice knew how tiresome it was trying to fit in when everyone expected you to understand unspoken rules. With her, I did not feel so alone.</p>
